# Redbubble Discounts: Sell Your Art Online, Get 25% Off First Order, 700K+ Artists

Picture this: you're scrolling through your phone at 2am, looking for that perfect sticker to cover up the scratch on your laptop. Suddenly, you stumble upon a design so perfectly *you* that it feels like the artist crawled into your brain. That's basically Redbubble in a nutshell – a weird, wonderful corner of the internet where over 700,000 artists turn everyday objects into tiny masterpieces.

I'll be straight with you. Redbubble isn't trying to be Amazon. It's more like that quirky art fair you wander through on a Sunday afternoon, except it's open 24/7 and ships worldwide. The platform's been around since 2006 (yeah, that's like ancient internet years), and it's built on a simple idea: artists create, Redbubble handles the boring stuff like printing and shipping, and you get cool things covered in unique designs.

## What Makes Redbubble Different? (Spoiler: It's Not Just Stickers)

Here's the thing most people don't realize – Redbubble offers over 70 different products. We're talking everything from the obvious stuff (t-shirts, phone cases, stickers) to things that make you go "wait, they print on *that*?" (shower curtains, pet mats, duvet covers).

The platform operates on a print-on-demand model, which is fancy speak for "nothing gets made until someone actually buys it." This means less waste, and it means artists can experiment without having to drop thousands on inventory. Every design you see comes from an actual human being trying to make a living doing what they love.

What's happening behind the scenes is pretty straightforward. An artist uploads their design, chooses which products it goes on, sets their markup (usually somewhere between 10-30%), and then Redbubble takes care of everything else. The base prices cover production and shipping, and artists earn money from the markup they add on top.

## What Does Stuff Actually Cost? (The Real Numbers)

Let me break down the pricing because it's not exactly straightforward at first glance. Redbubble doesn't let artists set random prices – there's a structure to it.

Here's how it works: Redbubble sets base prices that cover their costs. Then artists add their markup percentage. The customer pays the total, and the artist gets the markup amount (minus some platform fees, more on that in a sec).

| Product Type | Typical Base Price | Common Artist Markup | Final Customer Price | Artist Earns |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Small Sticker | ~$2.00 | 50-100% | $3.00-$4.00 | $1.00-$2.00 |
| Classic T-Shirt | ~$18.50-$20.00 | 20-30% | $22.20-$26.00 | $3.70-$6.00 |
| Premium Hoodie | ~$38.00-$42.00 | 20-30% | $45.60-$54.60 | $7.60-$12.60 |
| Phone Case | ~$15.00-$18.00 | 20-30% | $18.00-$23.40 | $3.00-$5.40 |
| Art Print | ~$12.00-$25.00 | 20-40% | $14.40-$35.00 | $2.40-$10.00 |
| Coffee Mug | ~$12.00-$14.00 | 20-30% | $14.40-$18.20 | $2.40-$4.20 |

Keep in mind that Redbubble frequently runs sales that can knock 10-50% off these prices. When that happens, the artist still gets their percentage of the sale, but it's calculated from the discounted base price. So if a shirt normally gives an artist $4 and there's a 10% discount, they'd make $3.60 instead.

## The Artist Side: How People Actually Make Money Here

Let's get real about earnings. Redbubble introduced a tiered fee structure in 2025, and it's been... let's say "controversial" is putting it mildly.

**The Three Tiers:**

**Standard Tier:** New and casual artists start here. Platform takes 50% of monthly earnings as a fee. Yeah, you read that right – 50%. But wait, there's a cap of $150 per payment period, which protects artists who are doing well.

**Premium Tier:** More established artists land here. Platform fee drops to 20% of monthly earnings. Still capped at $150 max.

**Pro Tier:** The dream tier. High-performing artists who consistently sell and engage with the platform. No platform fees. No excess markup fees. Just pure profit margin.

There's also this thing called the "excess markup fee" – if you price things more than 20% above base price, Redbubble takes an additional 50% of anything earned above that 20% threshold. It's their way of keeping prices competitive, but it also means you can't just slap a 200% markup on everything and call it a day.

## What Real Users Are Saying (The Unfiltered Version)

I dug through recent reviews from actual buyers and sellers in late 2025 and early 2026, and the feedback is... mixed, but in an interesting way.

**On the Buyer Side:**
One person raved about ordering art prints that arrived "absolutely gorgeous." Another mentioned buying custom t-shirts consistently and always being happy with quality. The platform has over 28,000 reviews on Trustpilot with generally positive sentiment for product quality.

But there are complaints too. Shipping can be unpredictable. Some folks ordered for Christmas and didn't receive items by the promised date. Customer service responses are hit or miss – sometimes great, sometimes you're talking to a wall.

**On the Artist Side:**
The stories vary wildly. One artist (Nettlesontoast) mentioned getting daily sales to the point where notification emails feel like spam. They've been on the platform for years and have some semi-viral designs. Their advice? Patience. It can take months or even years for designs to catch on.

Another seller (missouri76) focuses on unique, detailed art created with Procreate. With over 600 designs, nearly half have sold at least once. They emphasize it's about luck, niche knowledge, and artistic talent.

But then you have artists like RozzWilliam1334 who started in 2019 and made only six sales over three years. Their takeaway? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's more about enjoying the creative process.

The consensus seems to be: if you're hoping to make thousands immediately, you'll probably be disappointed. If you see it as a way to share your art with the world and maybe make some beer money over time, it could work out.

## Products That Actually Sell

Success on Redbubble tends to concentrate around certain product types. Based on what artists report and what the data shows:

**High-Volume Winners:**
- Stickers (cheap, easy impulse buys)
- T-shirts (classic, everyone needs them)
- Phone cases (people love personalizing their tech)
- Art prints and posters
- Coffee mugs

**Lower Volume but Higher Margin:**
- Hoodies and premium clothing
- Home decor items
- Specialty items like shower curtains or duvet covers

The trick is that you don't pick just one product. Most successful artists enable their designs on as many products as possible. Why? Because more products mean more listings, which means more chances to show up in search results.

## The Actual Shopping Experience

As a customer, the site is pretty straightforward. You search for what you want (maybe "funny cat stickers" or "cyberpunk t-shirt"), browse through thousands of options from different artists, and pick what speaks to you.

The product pages show you mockups of the design on different items. Quality is generally solid – these aren't those cheap prints that crack after one wash. Redbubble uses decent production facilities scattered around the world, which helps with shipping times but can also lead to some variation in quality depending on which facility produces your item.

Shipping costs vary based on your location and what you're ordering. Standard shipping is reasonable but not exactly cheap. They do have a bulk order program where orders over $750 qualify for potential discounts up to 55% off and might include free shipping.

Returns are handled through Redbubble, not individual artists, which is actually pretty nice. You get 90 days to request a return or exchange, though the actual terms depend on the specific product and situation.

## Is It Worth Your Time (And Money)?

**For Shoppers:**
If you want genuinely unique designs that you won't see everyone else wearing, 👉 [Redbubble delivers](https://redbubble.com). You're supporting independent artists, which feels good. Prices are higher than mass-market retailers, but that's the trade-off for originality.

Watch for those promotional emails and sales. With a 25% discount, prices become much more reasonable. The quality is solid for most items, though some products (like premium hoodies) are worth the investment more than others.

**For Artists:**
This is trickier. Redbubble makes it incredibly easy to get started. Upload your design, and you're live on a marketplace that gets millions of visitors monthly. You don't handle production, shipping, or customer service. That's huge.

But the fee structure means you're giving up a significant chunk of your earnings unless you reach Pro tier. The marketplace is *incredibly* competitive – you're up against 700,000+ other artists. SEO knowledge helps. Marketing outside the platform helps more.

Think of Redbubble as one channel in a broader strategy rather than your only income source. Use it to test designs, build an audience, and diversify your revenue streams. Some artists make decent passive income. Most make a little pocket money. Very few make a living solely from Redbubble.

## How to Actually Succeed (From People Who Have)

If you're serious about trying Redbubble as an artist, here's what the successful sellers say:

**Upload Consistently:** Don't just throw up five designs and call it done. The more designs you have, the more chances to be found. Aim for at least 50-100 to start.

**Optimize for Search:** Use relevant tags, good titles, and descriptions. Think about what people actually search for. "Funny cat" will get more searches than "Whimsical feline portrait."

**Know Your Niche:** Generic designs get lost in the noise. Find your thing – whether that's minimalist geometric patterns, witty text-based designs, or hyper-specific fandoms – and own it.

**Enable Multiple Products:** Don't limit yourself to just t-shirts or just stickers. More products = more visibility in search results.

**Price Competitively:** That 20% markup sweet spot exists for a reason. Go higher and you trigger extra fees plus price yourself out of casual buyers.

**Be Patient:** Most successful artists report it taking 6-12 months before seeing consistent sales. The platform rewards longevity.

## The Bottom Line

Redbubble occupies this weird middle ground between Etsy's handmade marketplace and Amazon's corporate efficiency. It's not perfect. The fees can sting. Competition is fierce. But for artists who want to focus on creating rather than running an e-commerce business, it's a legitimate option.

For shoppers, it's a treasure trove of unique designs if you're willing to pay a bit more than big box retail. Use those promotional codes (seriously, never buy at full price), check artist profiles before purchasing, and you'll probably end up with something that makes you smile.

The platform continues to evolve. Recent traffic shows they're still pulling in around 25 million monthly visits. The community is active. Artists are creating. Buyers are buying.

Is it going to make you rich overnight? Nope. Could it be a fun way to monetize your creativity or find that perfect gift nobody else will have? Yeah, probably.

👉 [Start exploring Redbubble](https://redbubble.com) and see what weird, wonderful things you discover. Whether you're creating or shopping, there's something there for people who appreciate art that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Just remember – life's too short for boring t-shirts.
